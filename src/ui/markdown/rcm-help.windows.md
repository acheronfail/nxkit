# Sending a payload

On Windows platforms, installing a driver is required. You only need to do this once.

1. Connect a Nintendo Switch in RCM mode
2. Download `Zadig` from https://zadig.akeo.ie/ and run it
3. In `Zadig`, choose `APX`
4. In `Zadig`, select `libusbK`
5. In `Zadig`, select `Install Driver`

Once you've installed the driver, sending payloads should work.
